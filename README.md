# alx-low_level_programming

Short story: I was among the students enrolled in alx scholarship program(C12). It was all good until it became a battle between my degree and the alx program. I had to defer. On returning, School work became more intense and affected my focus on the alx programme. Despite being done with SE foundation, I couldn't move on to specialization as I didn't pass the threshold.
Fast forward to being done with my degree, found out I still have my access on the intranet, I want to redo the SE foundation in 6 months or less. This is because I can't think of a better programme than alx out here.

So the activity on this repository will be kind of a revision.
